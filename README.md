# Cub3D
Cub3D is a 1337 school project that provides an introduction to the raycasting technique, which was used in one of the earliest 3D games in history, Wolfenstein 3D.

## Raycasting
Raycasting is a powerful method of rendering 3D graphics that creates a virtual environment by tracing the path of light from the viewer's perspective. Cub3D takes this concept and applies it to create a 3D game environment, mimicking the classic style of games like Wolfenstein 3D.
The project provides a solid foundation for students interested in game development or computer graphics.
